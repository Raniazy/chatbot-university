# Chatbot University

## What is it?

The main goal is to collect the most interesting learning sources for building and desiging chatbots.
I would also like to include a lot of samples, starter-kits and hands-on to make a jump-start into building a bot as easy as possible.

Now it's your turn. Feel free to make any contributions :)
